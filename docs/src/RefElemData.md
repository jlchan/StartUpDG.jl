# `RefElemData` type

[`RefElemData`](@ref) contains the following fields
* `element_type::AbstractElemShape`: element shape. `Line, Tri, Quad, Hex, Wedge, Pyr, Tet` currently supported.
* `approximation_type`: approximation type. Defaults to `Polynomial()`, but `SBP()` is also supported (see [RefElemData based on SBP finite differences](@ref)).
* `Nfaces`: number of faces on a given type of reference element.
* `fv`: list of vertices defining faces, e.g., `[1,2], [2,3], [3,1]` for a triangle
* `Fmask`: indices of interpolation nodes which lie on the faces
* `rst::NTuple{Dim, ...}`: tuple of vectors of length `N_p`, each of which contains coordinates of degree ``N`` optimized polynomial interpolation points.
* `rstq::NTuple{Dim, ...}`,`wq`, `Vq`: tuple of volume quadrature points, vector of weights, and quadrature interpolation matrix. Each element of `rstq` and `wq` are vectors of length ``N_q``, and `Vq` is a matrix of size ``N_q \times N_p``.
* `N_{\rm plot}`: the degree which determines the number of plotting points ``N_{p,{\rm plot}}``.
* `rstp::NTuple{Dim, ...}`, `Vp`: tuple of plotting points and plotting interpolation matrix. Each element of `rstp` is a vector of length ``N_{p,{\rm plot}}``, and `Vp` is a matrix of size ``N_{p,{\rm plot}} \times N_p``.
* `rstf::NTuple{Dim, ...}`,`wf`, `Vf`: tuple of face quadrature points, weights, and face interpolation matrix. Each element of `rstf` and `wf` are vectors of length ``N_f``, and `Vf` is a matrix of size ``N_f \times N_p``.
* `nrstJ::NTuple{Dim, ...}`: tuple of outward reference normals, scaled by the face Jacobian. Each element is a vector of length ``N_f``.
* `M`: mass matrix computed using quadrature. Size ``N_p \times N_p``
* `Pq`: quadrature-based ``L^2`` projection matrix. Size ``N_p \times N_q``.
* `Drst::NTuple{Dim, ...}`, `LIFT`: differentiation and lifting matrices. Differentiation matrices are size ``N_p \times N_p,`` while lift matrices are size ``N_p\times N_f``.

This list is incomplete; other fields are stored or accessible but currently only used for internal computations.

Mass, differentiation, lifting, and interpolation matrices can be specialized. For example, these matrices are dense `Matrix{T}` type for lines and triangles, but could also be stored as sparse matrices for quadrilaterals and hexahedra.

# Setting up `rd::RefElemData`

The struct `rd::RefElemData` contains data for a given element type. All common reference elements are supported: `Line`, `Tri`, `Quad`, `Tet`, `Pyr`, `Wedge`, and `Hex`.

To initalize a `RefElemData`, just specify the element type and polynomial degree.
```julia
N = 3

# 1D elements 
rd = RefElemData(Line(), N)

# 2D elements
rd = RefElemData(Tri(), N)
rd = RefElemData(Quad(), N)

# 3D elements
rd = RefElemData(Tet(), N)
rd = RefElemData(Pyr(), N)
rd = RefElemData(Wedge(), N)
rd = RefElemData(Hex(), N)
```

## Specifying different quadrature rules.

By default, [`RefElemData`](@ref) initializes volume and surface quadrature rules to be the minimum rules which exactly integrate the unweighted volume and surface mass matrices. If different quadrature rules are desired, they can be specified as follows: 
```julia
N = 3

# create degree N tensor product Gauss-Lobatto rule
r1D, w1D = gauss_lobatto_quad(0, 0, N)
rq, sq = vec.(StartUpDG.meshgrid(r1D))
wr, ws = vec.(StartUpDG.meshgrid(w1D))
wq = @. wr * ws

rd = RefElemData(Quad(), N; quad_rule_vol = (rq, sq, wq),  
                           quad_rule_face = (r1D, w1D))
```
This results in a DG spectral element method (DG-SEM) discretization, with a diagonal lumped mass matrix and differentiation matrices which satisfy a summation-by-parts property.

By default, `RefElemData` is constructed for a nodal basis (in order to facilitate curved meshes, connectivity, etc). The interpolation nodes are computed using an [interpolatory](https://doi.org/10.1137/141000105) version of the [warp-and-blend](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10665-006-9086-6) procedure. 

## `RefElemData` based on SBP finite differences

It is also possible to construct a [`RefElemData`](@ref) based on [multi-dimensional SBP finite difference operators](https://doi.org/10.1137/15M1038360). These utilize nodes constructed by [Tianheng Chen and Chi-Wang Shu](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2017.05.025), [Ethan Kubatko](https://sites.google.com/site/chilatosu/ethan-bio), and [Jason Hicken](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-020-01154-8).

Some examples:
```julia
N = 3
rd = RefElemData(Quad(), SBP(), N) # defaults to SBP{TensorProductLobatto}
rd = RefElemData(Quad(), SBP{TensorProductLobatto}(), N) 

rd = RefElemData(Hex(), SBP(), N) # defaults to SBP{TensorProductLobatto}
rd = RefElemData(Hex(), SBP{TensorProductLobatto}(), N) 

rd = RefElemData(Tri(),  SBP(), N) # defaults to SBP{Kubatko{LobattoFaceNodes}}
rd = RefElemData(Tri(),  SBP{Hicken}(), N) 
rd = RefElemData(Tri(),  SBP{Kubatko{LobattoFaceNodes}}(), N) 
rd = RefElemData(Tri(),  SBP{Kubatko{LegendreFaceNodes}}(), N) 
```
Quadrature rules of both degree `2*N-1` (up to `N = 6`) and `2*N` (up to `N = 4`) are supported on triangles. For `Line`, `Quad`, and `Hex` elements, `RefElemData(..., SBP(), N)` is the same as the `RefElemData` for a DG-SEM discretization, though some fields are specialized for the SBP type. These SBP-based `RefElemData` objects can also be used to initialize a mesh (for example, `md = MeshData(uniform_mesh(rd.element_type, 4)..., rd)`). 

On triangles, we have the following SBP types with the following properties:
* `SBP{Kubatko{LobattoFaceNodes}}`: degree `2N-1` accurate quadrature rules with `N+2` Lobatto nodes on each face. Nodes for `N=4`:

* `SBP{Kubatko{LegendreFaceNodes}}`: degree `2N-1` accurate quadrature rules with `N+1` Legendre nodes on each face. For `N = 1,...,4`, these are the same as the nodes constructed by Chen and Shu. Nodes for `N=4`:

* `SBP{Hicken}`: degree `2N` accurate quadrature rules with `N+2` Lobatto nodes on each face. Nodes for `N=4`:

## Tensor product `RefElemData` on wedge elements

!!! warning "Experimental implementation"
    This is an experimental feature and may change in future releases.
    
There is experimental support for `RefElemData`s created from tensor products of triangular and 1D `RefElemData` objects. 
```julia
line = RefElemData(Line(), N_line)
tri  = RefElemData(Tri(), N_tri)
rd   = RefElemData(Wedge(), TensorProductWedge(tri, line))
```
This new `rd::RefElemData` can then be used to create a wedge-based `MeshData`. The individual `RefElemData` objects can be accessed from `rd.approximation_type::TensorProductWedge`.
