# Overview

This package contains routines to initialize reference element operators, physical mesh arrays, and connectivities for nodal DG methods. Codes roughly based on *Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods* by Hesthaven and Warburton (2007).

## A short example

```julia
using StartUpDG

# polynomial degree and mesh size
N = 3
K1D = 8

# init ref element and mesh
rd = RefElemData(Tri(), N)
VXY, EToV = uniform_mesh(Tri(), K1D)
md = MeshData(VXY, EToV, rd)

# Define a function by interpolation
(; x, y ) = md
u = @. exp(-10 * (x^2 + y^2))

# Compute derivatives using geometric mapping + chain rule
(; Dr, Ds ) = rd
(; rxJ, sxJ, J ) = md
dudx = (rxJ .* (Dr * u) + sxJ .* (Ds * u)) ./ J
```
